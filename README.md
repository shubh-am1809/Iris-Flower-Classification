Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on sepal and petal
measurements.

# Approach:
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset
- Selected sepal and petal measurements as features
- Trained a Logistic Regression classification model
- Evaluated model using accuracy and classification report
  
# Conclusion:
The model achieved high accuracy and successfully classified
iris flower species based on their measurements.
